  "key_insights": "Collins Aerospace shows strong Q4 2023 performance with a 14% revenue increase and a 34% operating profit increase. This suggests good growth and profitability. However, it's important to acknowledge the reliance on RTX's overall financial health. The estimated full-year revenue of $26.25 Billion from 2023, as indicated in previous search results, will be used. Operating profit for 2023 increased by 34% year over year. It is important to note that airlines are pushing back on pricing with suppliers like Collins Aerospace. This could affect future profit margins.",
