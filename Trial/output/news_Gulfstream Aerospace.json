  "key_insights": "Gulfstream is experiencing significant delays in G700 deliveries due to supplier issues, engine shortages (Rolls-Royce Pearl 700), and quality control problems. These issues have led to missed delivery targets and could negatively impact financial performance and reputation. While overall deliveries have increased and the G800 has received FAA and EASA approvals, the G700 delays are a major concern. Tariffs also pose a risk.",
